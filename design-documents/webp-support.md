## Add support for the WebP image format.

### Terms

WebP is an image format employing both lossy and lossless compression.
https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/

### Overview

Using WebP images should speed up a page load for customers.
WebP offers 25 â€“ 35% smaller file sizes in compare with JPEG with the same quality. ([WebP Compression Study](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_study))

[Supporting WebP by browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webp)

### Design

On image resizing for each size, Magento can create one more image in WebP format.
For prevention unexpected resource consumption it can be managed by configuration and by default be disabled.
A web server will be responsible for the decision which file send.
This decision will be made by availability the requested image with WebP extension and supporting WebP by the browser using the Accept header.

#### Component Dependencies

This functionality requires an asynchronous image resizing to avoid degradation on adding images to the gallery and resizing all images.

### Prototype or Proof of Concept

Example of a configuration for Nginx.

```nginx
map $http_accept $webp_suffix {
    default   "";
    "~*webp"  ".webp";
}
```

```nginx
location ~* \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)$ {
    try_files $uri$webp_suffix $uri $uri/ /get.php$is_args$args;
}
```

With such configuration when /path/to/image.jpg is requested if the browser supports WebP and /path/to/image.jpg.webp exists the last one will be sent.
